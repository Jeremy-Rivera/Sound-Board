# Simple Sound Board

This is a simple sound board project empasizing the <audio> html tag.
I haven't used this tag much but I thought this project to be a good practice. The project inspiration came from the 50 projects in 50 days course I mentioned in previous repositiories. I will likely style it much differently than the course showed, because it looked atrocious, but the content will largely remain the same.
